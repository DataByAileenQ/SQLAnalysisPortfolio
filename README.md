# 📊 SQL Portfolio by Aileen Q

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! 🎉 This repository is a dedicated space where I’m showcasing SQL projects and scripts that I’ve developed to demonstrate my growing expertise in data analytics. Each project reflects hands-on experience with SQL, data manipulation, and analysis, with a focus on solving real-world data challenges.
