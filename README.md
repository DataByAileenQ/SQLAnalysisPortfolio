# 📊 SQL Portfolio by Aileen Q

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! 🎉 This repository is a dedicated space where I’m showcasing SQL projects and scripts that I’ve developed to demonstrate my growing expertise in data analytics. Each project reflects hands on experience with SQL, data manipulation, and analysis, with a focus on solving real-world data challenges.

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

This portfolio showcases my approach to SQL, which goes beyond just writing code. I focus on crafting clear and insightful explanations for each query, ensuring that both technical and non-technical audiences can easily understand its purpose and impact. With a background in **Data Analytics**, **UX Research**, and **Management Information Systems**, I aim to bridge the gap between data and those who can benefit from it, regardless of their technical expertise.

## 📂 Projects

Each project demonstrates my ability to write efficient SQL queries, extract and transform data, and uncover meaningful insights to inform decision-making. 

These projects present a mix of challenges, from understanding customer behavior and optimizing business strategies to analyzing trends and performance metrics. My goal is to provide data-driven recommendations that are both insightful and actionable.
